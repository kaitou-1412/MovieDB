# MovieDB
This is an interactive Movie Database app using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). We use an API: [the Open Movie DataBase](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to get information about movies and display them on screen using react components. We also use hooks such as the useState hook to create a functional state.
